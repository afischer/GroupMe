# groupme
A groupme client for iOS. Currently in spaghetti code form.

## Installation
1. Install cocoapods if you don't have it. You can use homebrew.
2. Run `pod install` within the directory.
3. Open `GroupMe.xcworkspace`
4. Set the target to an iOS device. iPads currently crash and I don't remember why
but there was a reason. Use an iPhone. I like using the 7.
